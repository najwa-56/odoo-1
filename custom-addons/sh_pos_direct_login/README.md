About
============
POS Direct Login Without Odoo Backend. This module is very useful for pos users. Normally pos user logged its redirect to odoo backends than the user needs to go point of sale and start/resume the session. Our module helps to save this unusual time, It will directly redirect you to the pos screen instead of odoo backend. Cheers!

3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list. 
5) search module name and hit install button.
